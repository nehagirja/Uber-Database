-- PURPOSE:
-- These blocks demonstrate how to cancel a trip using the `trip_cancellation_pkg.cancel_trip` procedure.
--
-- RULES ENFORCED BY THE PROCEDURE:
-- 1. The Trip ID must exist.
-- 2. A trip cannot be cancelled if:
--    - It is already marked as 'completed'
--    - It is already marked as 'cancelled'
--    - It is currently 'in progress'
-- 3. Upon valid cancellation:
--    - Feedback, rating, and timing fields in TRIP will be nullified.
--    - The payment_id will be cleared.
--    - A new TRIP_STATUS record will be inserted with status = 'cancelled'
--    - `updated_by` will reflect the current Oracle user.
